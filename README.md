# Android-basics-quiz-app
#### Android Basics Udacity program 3rd project 

This is Quiz app about Android Basics Udacity and Google Scholarship program.

What my app has:

- **Multilanguage:** English – Lithuanian.

- **Five layouts/activities:** main screen, checkbuton questions/answers, radiobutton questions answers, results and video.
All has separate landscape layout to fit the screen nice. 

- **Images:** all images has different sizes in all drawable folder from xxxhdpi to mdpi. 
Of course, you did not notice that on your phone, but I hope it help for better app performance.

- **Toasts:** there are toast messages for empty answers, for correct answer and for wrong answer.
Pushing back button when questions are answered is disabled (no coming back to last activity, 
instead you get toast asking if you want to restart quiz and if you push back one more time you go to the main page).

- **Progress bar:** you can see how many questions you answered.

- **Quiz questions:** there is 10 questions in different tools – editText, checkBox and radioButtons.

- **Answers:** after each question, which is showed in separate view, you see answers:  
green – correct answer and red – wrong. Answers are not clickable anymore. Also you see answer pictures. 
Plus you get toast about your points and answer.

- **Navigation:** you navigate and submit questions with one floating button.

- **Results:** you get 1 point for each correct answer – max 10 points. In results page you see the final points and some additional text and “present”, which depends on your points (5 different categories).

:exclamation: **Spoiler alert** :exclamation: It is about our Scholarship course, but not about coding :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
